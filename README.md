# Mike PontoN - Portfolio

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.5.

# About
The intention of this project was to create my small portfolio website. It was quickly put together in Angular in order to discover the main differnces between Vue.JS (my main Framework) and Angular v17.
My conclusion is that I still prefer Vue.Js but Angular might also come in handy occasionally.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
